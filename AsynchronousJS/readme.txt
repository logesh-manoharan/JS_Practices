Asynchronous programming - it is a form  of parallel programming.

Parallel Programming allows you to run certain block tasks in seperate threads
and get back when it is needed in the main task.


In JS, 3 main concepts are used to acheive the Asynchronous programming concept:

1. Callback functions
2. Promises
